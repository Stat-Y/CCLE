# Multivariate response regression withlow-rank and generalized sparsity

## Overview

Multiple response regression with low-rank and generalized sparsity, also can be noted as Multi-task learning with low-rank and generalized sparsity is a multi-task learning model which can be used for models assuming various structures for the coefficient matrix, e.g., one can assume low-rank and sparse coeffcient matrix or low-rank and generalized sparse coefficient matrix. Optimization for this model can be done with ADMM algorithm. See the main paper for more details.
